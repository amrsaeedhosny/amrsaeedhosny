A software engineer with over four years of experience working with different back-end, front-end, and DevOps technologies. I participated in building and enhancing more than 11 web-based applications, 8 with Spring Boot, 2 with Ruby on Rails, and 1 with PHP Laravel. Besides building various development tools with Python, such as boilerplate code generators, software packages, and deployment solutions. I also have experience managing the resources and infrastructure of different cloud solutions on GCP and AWS, including their cost analysis and optimization.
